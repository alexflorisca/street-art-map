Street art on a map

## TO DO:

Everything. But start with these.
 - Upload system for photos. Including a description that comes up when clicking on the marker. And street name because GPS isn't very accurate.
 - Up to date JSON file of all photo locations to be read by the map (maybe with AWS Lambda?)
